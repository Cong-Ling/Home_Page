My research focuses on the study of lattices and their applications to coding and cryptography, as well as exploring their connections with number theory and quantum information. A lattice is a regular array of points which generalizes the concept of the integers to multiple dimensions. Lattices are central objects in modern number theory, underpin sphere packing and capacity-achieving codes, and are the leading approach to post-quantum cryptography. Our work lies at the interface of information theory, number theory, cryptography and quantum information.
