## Frequently Asked Questions

* *Is topic "xyz" examinable?* All topics included in the lectures are examinable with the exception of the polynomial representation of cyclic codes.
* *Do I need to remember long formulas?* In general you are not expected to memorize long complicated formulas. However you will be expected to remember some basic and important formulas such as the Shannon formula.
* *How many problems will I choose in the exam?* There are no choices any more in the final exam. This is to discourage game playing and selective revision.
